# Fast Poke
- According to the PokeAPI documentation, as the `Type` model does not contain a `stats` property, the calculated `averageStat` will be always zero. In my opinion, it makes sense to calculate the average among all of existing pokemons.
- I tried to do not install any npm package.
- The endpoint doesn't support getting the list of pokemons [anymore?].
